# File-Zipper
The provided Python script contains a Huffman coding implementation, enabling file compression and decompression. The Huffmancode class within the codebase encompasses methods for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman coding technique. Upon initialization, the class accepts a file path, allowing users to specify the target file for compression. The compression() method applies Huffman encoding to compress the file, while the decompress() method reverses the process, restoring the original file from the compressed data. This script serves as a valuable tool for efficient data storage and transmission by reducing file sizes through Huffman coding.
